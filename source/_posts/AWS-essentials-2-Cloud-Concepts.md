# 1. Cloud computing 

Before cloud, bring a lot of waste. Cause you have to build your own server. 

After aws, initiated within seconds; treat these as temprorary and disposable; free from the inflexibility and constraints. 

# 2. strengths of cloud 

## 2.1 Agility 

### 2.1.1 speed 

1. Global reach 

2. Dramatic increase in agility 

### 2.1.2. experimentation 

1. operations as code 

2. safely experiment 

can spin up servers in minutes for experimenting; can return or re-purpose servers 

3. Testing using different configurations 
4. AWS cloudFormation enables templated environments 

### 2.1.3. culture of innovation 

1. Experiment quickly with low cost/ risk 


### 2.1.4 AWS Infrastructure 

To realize elasticity, scalability and reliability of computing resources, aws is build around region and availability zones. 

+ region 

    + physical location in the world 
    + contains multiple AZs

+ availability zones 
    + one or more discrete data centers 
    + redundant power/ networking/ connectivity 
    + housed in separate facilities 
    + fault tolerance 
        + applications operational during component failure 
        + build-in redundancy of components 
    + High availability 
        + systems always functioning and accessible 
        + downtime is minimized as much as possible 
        + without human intervention 

## 2.2 Elasticity, scalability and high performance 

1. Tools to run a wide range of applications 
2. auto scaling and elastic load balancing, scale up/ down based on demand 
3. deploy your system in multiple regions, low latency and better experience
4. innocative services and cutting-edge technology 
5. virtually any workload 

## 2.3 Security and Compliance 

1. Customer retains control over region where data located 
2. Security auditing often periodic and manual 
3. AWS cloud provides governance capabilities 

## 2.4 Reliability
1. Ability to recover from failures 
2. Dynamically acquire resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions
