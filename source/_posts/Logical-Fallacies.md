# Logical Fallacies

## Overconfidence

- Overconfidence — wishful thinking bias
    - most people think they are above avg
    - overestimate possibilities that they want to happen
    - **this could explain the trade in financial market**
    - overconfidence in friends and leaders

## Cognitive Dissonance

- Cognitive Dissonance  认知失调
    - this concept used to describe the mental discomfort that results from holding two conflicting beliefs, values or attitudes
    - People tend to seek consistency in their attitudes and perceptions, so this conflict causes feelings of unease or discomfort
    - This inconsistency between **what people believe and how they behave** motivates people to **engage in actions** that will help minimize feelings of discomfort
    - when we made decision, most people will still look for info about it, to self prove hisself right... in a lot different aspects... to make themselves happy, and to prove they are make right decision
    - disposition effect — gonna avoid that
    - what's the causes for that?
        - Forced Compliance
            - Engaging in behaviors that are opposed to your own beliefs due to external expectations, often for work, school, or a social situation
        - New Information
        - Decisions
            - People make decisions both large and small, on a daily basis
            - When faced with two similar choices, people often are left with feelings of dissonance because both options are equally appealing
            - Once they make decisions, people need to find a way to **reduce feelings of discomfort**
            - Accomplish by justifying why their choice was the best option so that they can believe they made the right decision

## Mental Compartments

- Mental compartments

## Anchoring

    - A tendency in ambiguous situations to allow one's decisions to be affected by some anchor
    - Our subconscious will do anchoring for us, lol
    - subjects unaware of their own anchoring behavior
    - stock prices anchored to past values, or to other stock in same market

## Representativeness Heuristic

- Representativeness Heuristic
    - People judge by similarity to familiar types, without regard to **base rate probabilities**
        - For example, we describe a person as artist, and skeptical, then what's the highest possible occupation of him/ her?
            - two choice: banker, and sculptress
            - should be banker, cause there are so many more bank tellers than sculptresses
    - Tendency to see patterns in what is really random walk
    - Stock price manipulators try to create patterns to fool investors

## Disjunction Effect

- inability to make decisions in advance in anticipation of future information

## Magical Thinking  & Quasi Magical Thinking

- Some coincidence lead you to build superstitious, but there are actually no karma (cause and effect)
- Belief that unrelated events are causally connected despite the absence of any plausible causal link between them, particularly as a result of supernatural effects.
- E.G
    - For voting, though our vote actually has basically 0 possibility to influence president election, but a lot people do it
    - For lottery, we somehow put more money if we select the number

## Personality Disorders

- culture and social contagion — collective memory
    - same effect, same memory, then similar decisions
- Antisocial Personality Disorder
